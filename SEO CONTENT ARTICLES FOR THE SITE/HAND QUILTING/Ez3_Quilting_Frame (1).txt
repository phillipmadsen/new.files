Title: Ez3 Quilting Frame

Have you been searching for a versatile, reasonably priced, and user-friendly quilting frame? If so, the Start-Right EZ3 from The Grace Company could be just what you've been dreaming of. Convenient and highly adjustable, the EZ3 quilting frame was designed with ease of use as a top priority. It is an ideal frame for both beginning and experienced quilters. Novices will appreciate its simple, straight forward operation, while veterans will appreciate how its streamlined workflow saves time and maximizes overall efficiency. 

<strong>Forget About Basting</strong>

For many people new to using a quilting frame, basting is one of the hardest aspects of the process to get used to. Owners of the EZ3 quilting frame can forget all about this problem, though, as it uses a totally basting-free system. Three tough and durable aluminum rails in conjunction with precision ratchets make handling your fabric and maintaining proper tension exceedingly easy -- even for first-time users!

<strong>A Wealth of Options</strong>

With the EZ3 quilting frame, you can make three different sizes of quilts. So, whether you're in the mood for experimenting with a series of small, relatively quick-to-construct quilts or you're ready to begin work on your large-scale masterpiece, the EZ3 has you covered. The quilting frame's three sizes consist of craft (27 inches), crib (59 inches), and queen (91 inches.) 

<strong>A Comfortable Workspace</strong>

Quilting is a time-consuming hobby. Once you begin a new project, you'll spend many hours working on it before it is finally complete. It is essential, both for your enjoyment and for doing your best work, to be comfortable while quilting. The EZ3 can accommodate people of nearly every size and shape. The quilting frame's work space can tilt from zero to forty degrees. This makes it easy to find the angle that works best for you.
