Title: Hand Quilting Hoops

Sewing Quilts by Hand

Instead of making quilts with sewing machines, many seamstresses stitch the old-fashioned way with a handheld needle and thread. To hold large pieces of layered fabrics, you need hand quilting hoops that latch securely. These specialized devices are not as easy to find nowadays with many people losing the art of sewing by hand, but a few manufacturers continue to sell the items. Dedicated quilters have their preference of hoops with the items usually made of a pliable wood that resists breakage as it is adjusted to fit the fabric. 

Hoops in Different Sizes

However, there are also larger hoops with sturdy legs and platforms made of metal that are designed to sit on the floor instead. No matter if it is a small or large device, the hoop is still meant for hand stitching quilted fabrics that will become bedcovers or wall hangings. One of the benefits of the larger hoops for sewing quilts is that several people can stitch at the same time to complete a project faster. This allows people to have a traditional quilting bee to make a gift designed for a wedding or baby shower. 

Able to Hold Thick Materials

When selecting hand quilting hoops, the items look similar to the ones made for embroidery stitching. However, the devices made for quilting are able to hold thicker or multiple layers of fabric better to make stitching easier. In the past, all hand quilting hoops were round, but engineers now understand the square ones are easier to work with. The delicate weave of most fabrics receives less damage in a square hoop while allowing quilters to work on a large area.

There are Hoops with Accessories 

Quilting is a craft that is difficult to do in dim light, leading to manufacturers creating hoops that have lamps attached above the stitching project. Having a hoop that swivels and tilts is ideal to help each quilter make the best use of available light to make tiny stitches on the fabric. Because holding hand quilting hoops is difficult, many of the items are attached to stands that rest on the floor or a tabletop. The most popular way to work on a quilting project is still by using a traditional lap hoop that requires little storage space.
