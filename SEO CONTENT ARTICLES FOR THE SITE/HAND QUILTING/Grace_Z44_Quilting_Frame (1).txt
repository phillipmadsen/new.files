Title: Grace Z44 Quilting Frame

When choosing a hand frame for your quilting projects, there are four major points every quilter should consider:

<ul><li>Typically hand frames come with three rails. For easier management and a cleaner work flow, a fourth rail would be instrumental.</li>

<li>Look for an easy to maintain unit with precision ratchets and durable aluminum rails that simplifies fabric and tension manipulation without basting.</li>

<li>The scope of projects has to be taken into account. Many frames will only accommodate queen sizes and smaller. If you're working on larger sizes, you want a frame that handles them.</li>

<li>Flexibility is critical. If you have limited space, a frame that folds would be ideal. Even better, a unit that folds with fabric still installed. You should also consider height adjustable legs.</li></ul>
